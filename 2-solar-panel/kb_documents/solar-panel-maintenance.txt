Maintenance Instructions for Sunpower Solar Panel Models:

Sunpower X:

1. Inspect the solar panel frame and mounting system for any signs of damage or looseness. Tighten any loose connections and replace any damaged parts.
2. Clean the solar panel surface using a soft, non-abrasive cloth and a mild, pH-neutral cleaning solution. Avoid using harsh chemicals or high-pressure water, as they can damage the panel.
3. Check the electrical connections, including the wiring and the inverter, for any signs of wear or damage. Ensure that all connections are tight and secure.
4. Inspect the circuit breaker and other electrical components to ensure they are functioning correctly and in compliance with local electrical codes.
5. Monitor the solar panel's performance and energy output regularly. If you notice a significant drop in performance, contact a qualified solar technician for further inspection and troubleshooting.
6. Ensure that the solar panel's orientation and tilt angle are maintained as per the original installation, as this can impact energy production.
7. Stay up-to-date with any changes in local energy regulations or incentive programs, and make sure your solar system remains compliant.
